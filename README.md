# ðŸŽ® Kweeper : a Minesweeper game in C with SDL 2 ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ 

Kweeper is a 2D minesweeper I wrote in C using SDL 2 back in 2023. It uses my own rudimentary testing library [Confer](https://github.com/maloleroy/confer) to generate the Makefile and run the tests!

## Installation

### Dependecies

* GCC
* SDL 2
* Confer (only if you want to run the tests)

Here, having SDL 2 installed means having `sdl2-config` in your path, since `Makefile` uses `sdl2-config` to get the correct GCC flags.

### Building

Just use Make!
```bash
make bin/kweeper
```

## Usage

To display the help message, just type
```bash
./bin/kweeper --help
```

Here is the output:
```

  -h, --help       Displays this help message and exits
  -v, --verbose    Verbose mode. A lot of ouputs (for devs or bugs report)
